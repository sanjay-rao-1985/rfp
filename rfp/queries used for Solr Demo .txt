As a general rule, query text is case insensitive, meaning that you may use any combination of upper and lower case letters regardless of the case used in documents in the search collection. 

Terms preceded by the '+' operator are required, meaning that only documents containing those terms will be selected by the query.
Terms preceded by the '-' operator are prohibited, 

e.g president george +washington -bridge
Which selects documents which contain "Washington" but not "bridge". Selected documents do not have to contain "president" or "george", but they will be ranked higher if they do.

Boolean Operators
	 The basic Boolean operators are AND or &&, OR or ||, and unary and binary NOT or !.Evaluation is left to right, but parenthesis can be used to control the evaluation order. For example,\
	 
	 User Input                  								Interpreted as
	 George Washington              							George AND Washington
	 Boston OR Chicago                                          
	 (George AND Washington) OR (Abraham AND Lincoln)           George Washington OR Abraham Lincoln 
	 "George Washington" OR ("Abraham" AND "Lincoln")           "George Washington" OR "Abraham Lincoln" 
	 cat dog turtle -zebra                                       
	 What is aspirin?                                           Trailing ? is ignored
Selects all documents that do not contain "zebra". Documents which contain any subset of "cat", "dog", and "turtle" will be ranked higher.



e.g 
      AmerisourceBergen
	  AmerisourceBergen Model N
      AmerisourceBergen -(Model N)
    
	 Model N
	 (Model N) - hyderabad  => This query is getting inter
	 Model N-(hyderabad)
	 Model N -hyderabad  => could not find Hyderabad
	 
	 M?del N  => ? is a wild card char 
	 Describe * => selects any thing after Describer
